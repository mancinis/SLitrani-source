Where to put the 2 "database" files SplineFitDB.rdb and SpectraDB.rdb?

The simplest solution is to put them into the same directory as the one containing
the executable "litrani" [linux] or "litrani.exe" [Windows]. In that case, you have
nothing to do and litrani will immediatly find the 2 files. For instance,
 - if you start Litrani from the directory ".../litrani" where you have compiled
and linked it, then put the two database files there. 
 - if you start Litrani from the directory "$ROOTDEV/bin" [linux] or
"%ROOTDEV%\bin" [Windows] where it has been installed by the Makefile,then put the
two database files there. 

if you insist to not put the two database files into the directory where the
executable "litrani" is, but want to put these two files into a specified
directory, for instance

   /home/mnt/gentit/mydatabases [linux] or 
   D:\databases\mydatabases [Windows] 

it is also possible, but you have then to put in front of all your CINT macros
using them following line:

 TLitSpectrum::NameFile("/home/mnt/gentit/mydatabases/SpectraDB.rdb"); [linux] or 
 TLitSpectrum::NameFile("D:\\databases\\mydatabases\\SpectraDB.rdb"); [Windows]
